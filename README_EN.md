Mjga is a newly designed and built Java Web scaffold that brings you a modern Java programming experience.

## Containerization and Cloud Native 🍋

1. Manage the entire lifecycle and configuration of the application through `docker-compose.yml`.
2. Customize all configurations through the `.env` file.
3. Deliver the entire application and its supporting ecosystem components through `docker-compose.yml`.

## Out of box 🍌

1. Integrated with commonly used basic business functions, such as authentication, permission management, and cache
   abstraction.
2. Code Check&Format, CI/CD Plugin, Docker Integration are all ready to use out of the box.
3. Comprehensive, design-oriented, and isolated runtime environment unit tests.

## Modern Philosophy 🍒

1. Modern: technology choices closely follow the trends in the open-source community.
2. Configurable: supports component selection and configuration on a web page.
3. Meticulous coding: considers best practices for every variable, function, module, and component.
4. Not-all-in-one: both now and in the future, [MJGA](https://www.mjga.cc) will maintain its boundaries.

## Quick Start 🍉

### Start with Docker (Recommended)

1. Confirm the default environment variable configuration.

```shell
# env will be applied to compose.yaml
less ${projectRoot}/.env
```

2. [Install Docker.](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)

3. Start the container.

```shell
cd ${projectRoot}
docker-compose up -d
```

### Start Locally (Optional)

```shell
# confirm .env and make sure process can use it
nano/vim ${projectRoot}/.env
${projectRoot}/gradlew bootRun
```

### Generate DB Mapping Source

```shell
# confirm .env and make sure process can use it
nano/vim ${projectRoot}/.env
# generate schema mapping codes
./gradlew generateJooq
# output ->
# projectRootDir/build/generated-src
# └── jooq
#    └── tables # table mapping
#       ├── daos # Data Access Layer
#       ├── pojos # mapping dto
#       └── records # jooq query record

```
